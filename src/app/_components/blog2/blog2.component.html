                        <p> <span class="uppercase">T</span>he Fitness Industry is not just about GYMS. It includes the whole lot i.e. Martial Arts Clubs, Dance Clubs, Yoga Clubs, Indoor Adventures, Swimming Pools, Gymnastics and so much more. The Industry has further diversified with its channels of delivery. It is now available not just via physical locations but also on-demand or recorded streaming of training. </p>
                        <p> The impact of technology has brought a lot of changes to the fitness industry unlike another factor. &nbsp;In May, The IHRSA Global Report of May 2019, found “embracing fitness tech inside and outside the club” as the top trend followed by<em> <strong>members belonging to multiple clubs and studios and clubs acting as social hubs for their communities</strong></em><sup>1</sup>. &nbsp;The global fitness app market size is poised to grow by USD 1.68 billion during 2020-2024, progressing at a CAGR of almost 12% throughout the forecast period, according to the latest report by Technavio<sup>2</sup>. Since the past few years, fitness and health clubs and suppliers have invested in a wide variety of technology, from virtual fitness solutions to AI driven solutions. This can also be viewed as part if the greater consumer shift towards better experiences rather than single transactional benefits. </p>
                        <h1 style="font-size:22px;">
                        <strong>Which segment is it?</strong>
                    </h1>
                        <p> The segment called Wearable Fitness! And if you want to invest in the Fitness and Recreational Industry, Wearable Fitness is your best bet. The Future Market Insights Report titled <strong>“<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">Wearable Fitness Trackers Market</a>: </strong>Global Industry Analysis 2012 – 2016 and Opportunity Assessment 2017 – 2027” has found that the global wearable fitness market is expected to grow continuously at a CAGR of 15.8% in terms of value during the forecast period 2017 – 2027.

                        <h2 style="font-size:22px;">
                        <strong>What is Wearable Fitness?</strong>
                    </h2>
                        <p> The wearables market includes eDevices that are designed to cater for fitness. They come fitted with smart sensors and Bluetooth and a connection to the internet to measure bodily movements such as the steps taken, heartbeats, running speed, calories count, temperature, glucose measurement, sleep measurement etc. These devices are far more than a fashion statement. They can come in the form of a smart watch, Wristband, Smart shoe, Smart shirt/jacket etc. </p>
                        <h3 style="font-size:22px;">
                        <strong>What is the playing field like?</strong>
                    </h3>
                        <p> The major players amping-up the game are Fitbit, Garmin, Jawbone, Apple, Samsung, Fitbit, Pulsar, Sony and a lot of smaller players.

                        <p>What is the technology behind this?</p>
                        <p> The current technology being used includes computing, networking, positioning, Display and Sensor Technology. The race is all about the application of these technologies. This segment may as well see their own Tech innovation because there is a lot of demand and to move away from the clutter, serious companies will have to come up with significant differentiation. </p>
                        <h5 style="font-size:22px;">
                        <strong>What is causing this Demand?</strong>
                    </h5>
                        <p> There is a need for people to be have newer smart gadgets. Every new version is received with as much anticipation as the previous version. Consumers want to be trendy. Increasing health consciousness is another reason. Increase in health issues like obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases have created a need to collect metrics to maintain and develop a healthy lifestyle or manage and prevent chronic diseases. Good metrics will aid research. Consumers feel wearable fitness gadgets will increase the efficiency of exercise and improve quality of life. </p>
                        <p> The increase in demand for connected devices has promoted wearable fitness technology. The IOT things is really a factor where convenience is sought. Consumers want everything to be interconnected and easily accessible to make their life easier. </p>
                        <p> This is a key part of todays’ fitness culture. This will lead to adoption of technology and will be native to the current younger generation aged between 6-12 years. This will positively influence the fitness app market and have a growth trajectory<sup>4</sup>. </p>

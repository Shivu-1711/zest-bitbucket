                        <p> <span class="uppercase">T</span>he fitness industry and all others that offer physical experiences have been affected greatly by Corona Virus. Gyms, fitness studios and recreational centers have been forced to adapt, innovate to survive. Financial implications have been severe. At the peak of COVID 19 pandemic Phase 1, the traditionally high-income months of April and May received zero operational revenue. &nbsp;CNBC has reported that both Gold’s Gym and 24-Hour Fitness, have had to file for bankruptcy protection.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                        <p>Most gyms have only kept a Skeleton staff to save costs. BNN Bloomberg reports that “<strong>Goodlife Fitness</strong> says 9,045 associates have been temporarily laid off”<a href="#"><strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong></a>. CTV News has reported <strong>Steve Nash Fitness World</strong> shut down and terminated roughly&nbsp;1,200 employees.<a href="#"><strong><sup>[3]</sup></strong></a></p>

                            <strong>Lowered Capacity</strong>
                        </h2>
                        <p>Coronavirus ushered in a new norm where reduced indoor capacity has had another crippling impact to this industry. The in-person training or classes look quite different, taking account of government-mandated safety protocols has made operations more expensive. For larger Gyms like Good Life or Repsol Sport Centre it is easy to space out and allow for greater social distancing. Capacity is the biggest challenge for smaller facilities.</p>
                        <p>Where it is an additional cost to adjust to the new changes, there is a lot of opportunity cost because not all equipment and space can be used. Drop-ins are unrealistic and wait lines are long. Increased cleaning after person is those many minutes less on the equipment and shortened activity times.</p>
                        <h3 style="font-size:24px;">
                            <strong>Low Confidence</strong>
                        </h3>
                        <p>Training with masks would be surreal but Covid-19 has made it real. Fitness conscious people are worried about the infection scenarios they can cause to their loved ones. They are also worried the extra time investment that comes long with the safety protocols. Many customers are now opting foe 1-on-1 training as it guarantees less exposure to people.</p>

                            <strong>Survival of the fittest?</strong>
                        </h4>
                        <p>With the lockdowns most, fitness business with little or any capacity started their journey to offer the experience virtually. Carl Macdonald of CityFit in Calgary says “The truth is that business models, pre-COVID-19 are now obsolete”<a href="#"><strong><sup>[4]</sup></strong></a>. Physical, hybrid and online experiences are popping up fast. </p>
                        <p>Luckily, some have been able to transfer that value online. Innovative Fitness based out of Vancouver, BC began offering virtual classes with 45 % of clients taking advantage. Over the first eight weeks of the lockdown, the company worked with 10,000 clients&nbsp;remotely<a href="#"><strong><sup>[5]</sup></strong></a>. Julia Bayne of Success Fitness (formerly&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">Crossfit 6S</a>) in Toronto, capitalized of the smaller home sizes of Downtown Toronto clients and customized service were online within 48 hours and had switched from group classes to&nbsp;one-on-one training<a href="#"><strong><sup>[6]</sup></strong></a>. Brent Bishop, owner&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">Think Fitness</a>&nbsp;in Toronto finds customers are increasingly finding value in virtual fitness training and has never been more busy. Bishop has converted one of the studios in his gym into a professional film studio from where he broadcasts live classes. </p>

                        <p>A trend to work-out in the open in groups has started. People are still looking to workout with their community. &nbsp;It is safer to working out outside, especially for a group. Yoga instructors, gymnastics coaches, fitness coaches are using the outdoor space more than before.&nbsp; ideally six feet apart from each other to maintain social distancing. People who still want to go to classes, exercise with their community can still do it outside. </p>

                        <p>IT can be safely said that hybrid fitness model (with both virtual and physical) is here to stay. It has brought new audiences to the fitness centers from far and wide. It has allowed customers to experience fitness at convenience and ease. It has compelled the fitness industry to evolve with adversity. Associated trend is the increase in sales of home gym equipment, wearable tech and fitness gaming. &nbsp;</p>
